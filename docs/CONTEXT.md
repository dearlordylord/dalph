# Ralph Tooling Context

This context names repository delivery-orchestration concepts. It is separate
from every target repository's application and domain model.

## Language

**Target application**:
The product system in a repository whose work Dalph coordinates.
_Avoid_: Ralph, delivery tooling

**Repository tooling**:
Software that builds, verifies, plans, or delivers changes to the target
application without becoming part of its product runtime or domain model.
_Avoid_: Target application, product runtime

**Dalph orchestrator**:
The graph-native repository tooling that coordinates delivery work. Ralph is
the retained product identity used in the original research record.
_Avoid_: New `ralph-run.sh`, shell-harness replacement

**Historical Ralph harness**:
The one-off `scripts/ralph-run.sh` experiment and its execution formats.
_Avoid_: Ralph architecture, compatibility baseline, legacy runtime

**Candidate tooling requirement**:
A possible Ralph requirement mined from evidence but not yet accepted by an
owning decision or implementation specification.
_Avoid_: Requirement, contract

**Accepted tooling requirement**:
A Ralph requirement explicitly selected by its owning tooling decision or
implementation specification.
_Avoid_: Observed shell behavior, candidate

**Managed execution**:
A run, attempt, claim, session, or artifact created and namespaced by the Ralph
orchestrator.
_Avoid_: Historical harness run, pre-existing workspace
